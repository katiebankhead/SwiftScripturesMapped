I showed my app to my roommate and asked for her feedback as a user. She thought that the design was fairly intuitive, and she clearly understood what to tap on in each view. The biggest issue she faced was lag time--there's a significant pause after selecting a book, and after selecting a chapter, before the next view appears. The HTML also took a few extra seconds to load. At some points, she wasn't sure if she did something wrong, or if she needed to re-select the chapter. In the future, I'd work to optimize the experience and make the content load faster.
